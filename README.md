# 👋 Hi, I’m Dita Biško

I’m a people-process professional with a background in **HR, employer branding, and learning design**, now diving deeper into the world of **code**.

## 🧠 Why I Code

Coding started as a curiosity — now it's a passion. I approach tech with the same mindset I brought to people and projects: thoughtful, hands-on, and always evolving.

My current interests:
- Systems programming (C, Bash)
- Python scripting and tooling
- Networks, Linux, and automation
- Building things that help **me understand deeply**, not just "make it work"

As part of my journey at **42 Berlin**, I’ve worked on several hands-on projects focused on systems programming, logic, and low-level development:

- **Minishell** – A custom Unix shell written in C, implementing command parsing, pipes, redirections, and environment handling.
- **Philopher** – A concurrency exercise using threads and mutexes to solve the classic Dining Philosophers problem.
- **Push Swap** – An algorithmic challenge that sorts integers using a limited instruction set and optimized moves.
- **FDF** – A 3D wireframe visualizer that parses height maps and renders them with isometric projection.
- **Minitalk** – A message-passing program using UNIX signals for inter-process communication.
- **Cub3D** – A raycasting engine for creating a simple 3D game, inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.

## 🌐 NetPractice – With a Twist

### 🔍 IP Subnet Properties Checker

This was part of the **NetPractice module**, but I wanted more than just to pass the assignment.

So I built a **Python tool** that:
- Calculates subnet info (network, broadcast, usable hosts, etc.)
- Identifies IP categories (private, loopback, reserved, etc.)
- Cross-validates results with Python’s `ipaddress` module
- Includes integration tests for edge cases and logic accuracy
