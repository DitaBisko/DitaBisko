# 👋 Hi, I’m Dita Biško

People-process professional turned software developer 🚀 

Fueled by curiosity, I’ve been loving the challenge of CS—at [42 Berlin](42berlin.de) and in building my own tools along the way.

## Example projects

### 🔍 IP attribute checker -> [repo](https://github.com/DitaBisko/42Berlin_NetPractice/tree/main/ip_attributes)

While diving into networking concepts, I built a CLI tool that calculates key IP network attributes.

  🛠️ **What it does:**
  - Calculates network, broadcast, usable IPs, CIDR, host count, etc.
  - Detects unique/reserved ranges (private, loopback, multicast...)
  - Cross-checks results using Python's `ipaddress` module
  - Includes integration tests for validation and learning

Other projects at **42 Berlin**, I’ve tackled low-level, logic-heavy challenges like:

- [**Minishell**](https://github.com/DitaBisko/42Berlin_minishell) – A basic Unix shell with pipes, redirections, and env handling.
- [**Philo**](https://github.com/DitaBisko/42Berlin_Philo/tree/main) – Solving the Dining Philosophers problem with threads and mutexes.
- **Push Swap** – Sorting integers with a custom algorithm and minimal moves.
- **FDF** – Visualizing 3D wireframes from height maps.
- **Minitalk** – Sending messages between processes via UNIX signals.
- **Cub3D** – A raycasting engine inspired by early 3D games.
