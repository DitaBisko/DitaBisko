# 👋 Hi, I’m Dita Biško

I’m a people-process professional with a background in HR, employer branding, and learning design. I'm now diving deeper into the world of code.

What started as a curiosity has turned into a passion. I bring the same thoughtful, hands-on approach to tech that I did to people and process work — always learning.

### 🛠️ 42 Berlin Projects
  
## 🌐 Example project – NetPractice – with a twist

### 🔍 IP Subnet Properties Checker -> [repo](https://github.com/DitaBisko/42Berlin_NetPractice/tree/main/ip_attributes)

This wasn’t part of the **NetPractice module**, but I built it to understand subnetting and network calculations.

🛠️ **What it does:**
- Calculates network, broadcast, usable IPs, CIDR, host count, etc.
- Detects unique/reserved ranges (private, loopback, multicast...)
- Cross-checks results using Python's `ipaddress` module
- Includes integration tests for validation and learning

Other projects at **42 Berlin**, I’ve tackled low-level, logic-heavy challenges like:

- **Minishell** – A basic Unix shell with pipes, redirections, and env handling.
- **Philo** – Solving the Dining Philosophers problem with threads and mutexes.
- **Push Swap** – Sorting integers with a custom algorithm and minimal moves.
- **FDF** – Visualizing 3D wireframes from height maps.
- **Minitalk** – Sending messages between processes via UNIX signals.
- **Cub3D** – A raycasting engine inspired by early 3D games.
